# Setup / Installation instructions

## Initialising a new project 

1. Create a package.json using the command `npm init -y`.
2. Install a dependency or 3rd party library (_code written by someone else_) using the command `npm install -D <name-of-library>`.
3. To use the library we need to make use of the `require` function in Node.
